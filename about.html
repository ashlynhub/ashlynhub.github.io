<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
Blossom Bakery Cafe is a small cafe created to leran more about us.
The goal of this website is to represent a calm, welcoming space where people can
enjoy fresh food, warm drinks, and quiet moments.
</p>

<p>
Our cafe is inspired by neighborhood bakeries where people come to relax, study,
or spend time with friends. Everything about Blossom Bakery is meant to feel
comforting, peaceful, and familiar.

<h2>Motive</h2>
<p>
We believe cafes should be warm and inviting. Food should feel homemade,
drinks should be enjoyed slowly, and the space should feel calm rather than rushed.
</p>

<p>
Soft cafe plays in the background to help create a relaxing experience.
